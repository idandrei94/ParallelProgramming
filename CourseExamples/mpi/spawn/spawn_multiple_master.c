/* The program demonstrates how to spawn some dynamic MPI processes.
 * This version uses one master process which creates two types of
 * slave processes with different argument vectors. The argument
 * vector contains the parameters passed to the program. Basically it
 * corresponds to a normal argument vector for C programs. The main
 * difference is that p_argv[0] contains the first parameter and not
 * the name of the program. The function which you will use to spawn
 * processes will build a normal argument vector consisting of the
 * program name followed by the parameters in "p_argv".
 *
 * A process or a group of processes can create another group of
 * processes with "MPI_Comm_spawn ()" or "MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple ()".
 * In general it is best (better performance) to start all processes
 * statically with "mpiexec" via the command line. If you want to use
 * dynamic processes you will normally have one master process which
 * starts a lot of slave processes. In some cases it may be useful to
 * enlarge a group of processes, e.g., if the MPI universe provides
 * more virtual cpu's than the current number of processes and the
 * program may benefit from additional processes. You will use
 * "MPI_Comm_spwan_multiple ()" if you must start different
 * programs or if you want to start the same program with different
 * parameters.
 *
 * There are some reasons to prefer "MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple ()"
 * instead of calling "MPI_Comm_spawn ()" multiple times. If you
 * spawn new (child) processes they start up like any MPI application,
 * i.e., they call "MPI_Init ()" and can use the communicator
 * MPI_COMM_WORLD afterwards. This communicator contains only the
 * child processes which have been created with the same call of
 * "MPI_Comm_spawn ()" and which is distinct from MPI_COMM_WORLD
 * of the parent process or processes created in other calls of
 * "MPI_Comm_spawn ()". The natural communication mechanism between
 * the groups of parent and child processes is via an
 * inter-communicator which will be returned from the above
 * MPI functions to spawn new processes. The local group of the
 * inter-communicator contains the parent processes and the remote
 * group contains the child processes. The child processes can get
 * the same inter-communicator calling "MPI_Comm_get_parent ()".
 * Now it is obvious that calling "MPI_Comm_spawn ()" multiple
 * times will create many sets of children with different
 * communicators MPI_COMM_WORLD whereas "MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple ()"
 * creates child processes with a single MPI_COMM_WORLD. Furthermore
 * spawning several processes in one call may be faster than spawning
 * them sequentially and perhaps even the communication between
 * processes spawned at the same time may be faster than communication
 * between sequentially spawned processes.
 *
 * For collective operations it is sometimes easier if all processes
 * belong to the same intra-communicator. You can use the function
 * "MPI_Intercomm_merge ()" to merge the local and remote group of
 * an inter-communicator into an intra-communicator.
 * 
 *
 * Compiling:
 *   mpicc -o spawn_multiple_master spawn_multiple_master.c -lm
 *   mpicc -o spawn_slave spawn_slave.c -lm
 *
 * Running:
 *   mpiexec -np <number of processes> spawn_multiple_master
